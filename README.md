# Video-AI
I'm am in search of Video AI expertise for the following:

- Allow user to enter prompt
- Have prompt transposed onto video
- Have video character respond onto video (or in early stages a still picture)
- Have the response text placed onto an object
- Save the exchange for a learning model.

See this video as an example - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPHIKKWuqj4

I am open to suggestions as I am still in the idea phase.
==================
Creating a system that allows users to interact with video characters, where the characters respond to user input (either in the form of text or eventually video responses), involves combining natural language processing (NLP), video processing, and machine learning. This solution would include several components:

    User Prompt Input: Capture the user input (text).
    Text Overlay on Video: Transpose the user prompt onto a video.
    Character Response: Generate a response from the character in the video (initially as text, and later as dynamic video).
    Store Interactions: Save the exchanges for learning purposes and model training.

Approach Overview

    User Input (Prompt): Use an input interface to allow the user to enter prompts (could be a web interface or a command-line input).
    Text Transposition: The prompt entered by the user will be overlaid onto a video or a still image.
    Character Response: In the first phase, the response will be generated as text, and in the second phase, we can move towards creating synthetic speech or even video responses.
    Store Data: Store all interactions, including user prompts, character responses, and metadata, in a database for future learning models.

Step-by-Step Python Code
1. Install Dependencies

First, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You will need libraries for:

    NLP (OpenAI for text generation)
    Video Processing (OpenCV and moviepy)
    Text-to-Speech (gTTS for initial implementation)

pip install openai opencv-python moviepy gtts

2. Setup for OpenAI Text Generation (Prompt Response)

For the AI character to respond to the user's prompt, we can use GPT-3 (or GPT-4) via OpenAIâ€™s API to generate natural-sounding responses.

import openai

# Initialize OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

def get_response_from_prompt(prompt):
    """Generate a response from the AI using OpenAI's API"""
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="text-davinci-003",  # or any GPT model of your choice
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example usage
user_prompt = "What is the capital of France?"
response = get_response_from_prompt(user_prompt)
print(f"AI Response: {response}")

3. Overlaying Text onto Video or Image (Using OpenCV and MoviePy)

In this step, we will overlay the prompt onto a still image or video.

import cv2
from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip, TextClip, CompositeVideoClip

def overlay_text_on_video(video_file, text, output_file):
    # Load the video file
    clip = VideoFileClip(video_file)
    
    # Create a text clip for overlay (you can adjust font size, color, etc.)
    txt_clip = TextClip(text, fontsize=50, color='white', font='Arial', stroke_width=2)
    txt_clip = txt_clip.set_pos('center').set_duration(clip.duration)
    
    # Combine the video and text clip
    video = CompositeVideoClip([clip, txt_clip])
    
    # Write the result to a file
    video.write_videofile(output_file, codec='libx264')

# Example usage
overlay_text_on_video("input_video.mp4", "What is the capital of France?", "output_video.mp4")

4. Generating Speech Response (Optional)

For now, the response will be in the form of text. In later phases, you can use a text-to-speech (TTS) system like gTTS to generate an audio response.

from gtts import gTTS
import os

def generate_speech_response(text):
    tts = gTTS(text=text, lang='en')
    tts.save("response.mp3")

    # Play the generated speech
    os.system("start response.mp3")  # For Windows, change command for other OS
    print("Speech generated and played.")

# Example usage
generate_speech_response("The capital of France is Paris.")

5. Store User and AI Interaction for Learning Model

You can store the user input and AI responses in a database (such as SQLite or a simple CSV file) for future training.

import csv
from datetime import datetime

def save_interaction_to_csv(user_input, ai_response):
    with open("interactions.csv", mode='a', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerow([datetime.now(), user_input, ai_response])

# Example usage
save_interaction_to_csv("What is the capital of France?", "The capital of France is Paris.")

6. Full Integration into a Video Response System

Combining the steps above, you can now build a system where:

    User enters a prompt.
    AI responds.
    The prompt is overlaid onto the video.
    AI response is generated.
    The interaction is saved.

def main():
    user_prompt = input("Enter your prompt: ")
    
    # Step 1: Get the AI's response
    ai_response = get_response_from_prompt(user_prompt)
    print(f"AI Response: {ai_response}")
    
    # Step 2: Overlay user prompt and AI response onto video
    video_file = "input_video.mp4"  # Path to your video file
    overlay_text_on_video(video_file, user_prompt, "output_with_prompt.mp4")
    overlay_text_on_video("output_with_prompt.mp4", ai_response, "final_output.mp4")
    
    # Step 3: Generate speech for AI's response (optional)
    generate_speech_response(ai_response)
    
    # Step 4: Save the interaction for learning models
    save_interaction_to_csv(user_prompt, ai_response)

# Run the program
main()

Explanation of Key Components:

    AI Response (OpenAI): The get_response_from_prompt() function uses OpenAI to generate text responses based on the user's input. The response is context-aware and natural-sounding.

    Text Overlay (OpenCV + MoviePy): The overlay_text_on_video() function allows you to overlay text (such as the prompt and AI response) onto a video. This can be expanded to handle video segments or different video files for dynamic interactions.

    Speech Response (gTTS): The generate_speech_response() function converts the AI-generated text response into speech. This adds interactivity and realism.

    Data Storage: Using the save_interaction_to_csv() function, you can store all interactions for future learning or model improvements.

Future Enhancements:

    Video Character Responses: Eventually, you can move from static images to animated video characters by generating synthetic video clips or avatars that respond to the user.
    Real-time Interaction: The system can be further enhanced to operate in real-time for interactive sessions.
    Machine Learning: You can use the stored interactions to fine-tune the AI's responses or use them for reinforcement learning to improve performance over time.

Conclusion:

This is a basic framework for an AI-driven interactive video system where the AI responds to prompts, overlaid onto video, with text or synthesized speech. The system also saves interactions for future learning, which can be further developed into an advanced AI agent with real-time video responses.
